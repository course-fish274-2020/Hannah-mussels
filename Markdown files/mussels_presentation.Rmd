## The Data

This project seeks to compare the abundance of sea star _Pisaster ochraceus_ and local mussels species in rocky intertidal zones across the US West coast. This project focuses on abundance data before and after a breakout of Sea Star Wasting Syndrome (SSWS).

Packages required : Tidyverse and Knitr

The data set used is from [Sea Star Wasting Syndrome impacts to intertidal communities via mass mortality of a keystone predator](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Data_for_Sea_Star_Wasting_Syndrome_impacts_to_intertidal_communities_via_mass_mortality_of_a_keystone_predator_/9795584)


## The relationship between sea stars and mussels

The sea star _Pisaster ochraceus_ is a key stone predator for intertidal communities. As a keystone predator these sea stars keep populations of competitively dominant species (mussels) in check. Some advantages of their role in intertidal communities include:

- Reducing competition for space
- Protecting populations of producers (i.e kelp) and their consumers
- Maintaining biodiversity

## Sea Star Wasting Syndrome (SSWS)

Though not much is known about the causes of SSWS, the disease can be fatal to sea stars and has been known to cause mass mortality. The disease begins with lesions and eventually deterioration of the sea star's body, ending in death.

## Reading in and Viewing the Data
```{r, include = FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(knitr)
library(tidyr)
```

```{r, include=FALSE}
abundance_data <- read.csv("../data/change in pisaster and mussels PISCO sites.csv")

mussel_data <- abundance_data %>%
  select(c(誰..site, 
          georegion,
          Mean.percent_cover_Mytcal..pre.SSWS,
          Mean.percent_cover_Mytcal..post.SSWS)) %>%
  rename(Pre = Mean.percent_cover_Mytcal..pre.SSWS,
         Post = Mean.percent_cover_Mytcal..post.SSWS, 
         Site = 誰..site,
         Region = georegion) %>%
  pivot_longer(c('Pre', 'Post'),
               names_to = "Relative_Time",
               values_to = "Mussel_Cover")


 pisaster_data <- abundance_data %>%
   select(誰..site, 
          georegion,
          Mean.Pisaster.density..pre.SSWS,
          Mean.Pisaster.density..post.SSWS) %>%
  rename(Pre = Mean.Pisaster.density..pre.SSWS,
         Post = Mean.Pisaster.density..post.SSWS,
         Site = 誰..site,
         Region = georegion) %>%
  pivot_longer (c('Pre', 'Post'),
                names_to = "Relative_Time", 
                values_to = "Pisaster_Density")

abundance_data2 <- merge(mussel_data, pisaster_data)
View(abundance_data2)
abundance_tibble <- as_tibble(abundance_data2)
abundance_table <- head(abundance_tibble)
```


```{r, echo=FALSE}
kable(abundance_table, col.names = c('Site', 'Region', 'Time Relative to SSWS',
                                     'Mussel Mean Percent Cover', 'Pisaster Mean Density'))
```
## Comparing _Pisaster_ density to Mussel percent cover

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(abundance_data2, aes(x = Mussel_Cover, y = Pisaster_Density, color = Relative_Time)) +
  geom_point() + scale_x_log10() + scale_y_log10() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  labs(color = "Time Relative to SSWS") +
  xlab("Mean Percent Cover of Mussels") +
  ylab("Mean Density of Pisaster")
  
```





## Change in Mussel Cover by Region

```{r, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(abundance_data2, aes(x = Mussel_Cover, fill = Relative_Time)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 10, position = "dodge") + xlab("Mean Percent Cover") +
  labs(fill = "Time Relative to SSWS") + theme_bw() +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Paired") +
  facet_wrap(~ Region)

    
```



## Conclusion

- After the occurrence of Sea Star Wasting Disease, average _Pisaster_ density decreased while average Mussel percent cover increased.
- This is most likely the result of _Pisaster's_ role as a keystone predator, without them mussels are left to out compete other species for space
- Some regions ,such as Southern California, saw a decrease in mussel cover post SSWS. This could be the results of regional environmental or biological factors.
- More research should be done to study the effect of SSWS on both _Pisaster_ and other members of the rocky intertidal community.
