Project Purpose: This project is designed to compare the relationship between sea star and mussels abundance data before
and after the occurence of Sea Star Wasting Syndrome (SSWS)



Project Directory:

  - Data: consists of the original data sets downloaded off figshare
      
      - change in pisaster and mussels PISCO sites.csv : a dataset that contains changes in abundance of mussels and Pisaster
      at various sites along the California coast
      
      - Copy of mussel_bed_limits.csv : a dataset that contains data on the size and limits of mussel beds
      
      - Copy of MusselSizeAll.csv : a dataset containing data on mussel body sizes
      
      - Copy of Spp_composition_all_years_stacked.csv : a data set containing the species composition of the sites along the 
      California coast
      

- Scripts: contains scripts mostly practice scripts done during 
  
      - reading_data.R : a script used for in-class practice before starting the project
    

      
- Output: Any output files such as HTML files 

  
      - mussels_markdown.html : the final product of the mussels markdown file
      
      - mussels_presentation.html : the final product (slide show) of the mussels presentation file
      
      
  
  - Markdown files: contain .Rmd files including the presentation file for this project
  
      - mussels_markdown.Rmd :  a Markdown file for the project includes code that manipulates the change in pisaster
      and mussels PISCO sites.csv dataset and creates a histogram comparing pre and post mean mussel cover
      
      - mussels_presentation.Rmd : a Markdown file for the presentation of this project, is essentially a newer, working form
      of mussels_markdown.Rmd, contains prose and code
      

 -  Images: contains any pictures used for this project

  
      - Pisaster Predate mussels.jpg : picture of sea stars feeding on bed of mussels
      
      - Seastar_white_lesions.jpg : picture of sea star with SSWS
  
  
  - .gitignore
  
  
  - .Rhistory
  
  
  - ReadMe : contains information about directory and project in general
  
  
  
  Plans for this Project:
  
  1) Create a better looking presentation with simplified code (put into pipes) and easy to read tables
  
  2) Create a graph that effectively and consicely compares mussel cover and sea star density before and after SSWS
  
  3) Potentially look into how species composition is affected as well
