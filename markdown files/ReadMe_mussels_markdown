The mussels_markdown is a combination of code, prose, and a plot that was produced
after manipulating data from the dataset containg changes in percent cover/abundace/density
of both the sea star Pisaster and mussels. 

More specifically, this markdown compares the mean percent cover of mussels before
and after sea stars were potentially removed by the occurence of sea star wasting 
disease in that community. 

A histogram was produced to compare the two columns of data.
