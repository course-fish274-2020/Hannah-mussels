This directory contains files and data for my mini project which looks into the relationship
between mussel abundance and sea star abundance before and after the occurence of sea star
wasting disease.

Data: at the moment consists of the original data sets downloaded off figshare

Documents: contains any text files

Scripts: contains scripts mostly practice scripts done during lecture

Output: Any output files such as HTML files

Due to complications with running .Rmd files while in their own folder all .Rmd files 
are left out in project directory
